# Mono-LQ3 Private MC production

In this directory you should find 5 directories, one for each step required for private MC production.
It should be possible to adapt the steps for any analysis as long as one makes the appropriate changes,
most of which are highlighted in the NOTES files.

Copy the steps directories into your chosen 'CMSSW_XXXX/src' and you should be good to go, simply follow
the NOTES in each of the steps directories respectively, starting with step_1.
